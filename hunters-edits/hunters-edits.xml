		<description>
			<p>You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You learn the invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the illusion or necromancy school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</li>

			<p>While wearing this circlet, the wearer's Charisma score decreases by 2. They also have advantage on initiative rolls. When making an attack roll, the wearer can use their reaction to gain a +5 bonus to the roll. They make this choice after they see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses. The wearer cannot use this ability again until they finish a short or long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a bonus action, three (or however many are remaining for the day) twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force appear in a triangle floating behind your head. When an enemy gets within ten feet of you, you may target them with 1-3 missiles. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, the missile does 2d4 force damage. If the attack roll scores a critical, the missile does 5d4 force damage instead of the 4d4 force that you would normally get on a critical. If any of the attack roll is a natural one, all missiles turn around and hit the caster for 3 force damage per missile. Regains all missiles at dawn. Missiles can not trigger on your turn. Missiles only trigger when someone enters the radius, starting within the zone or teleporting in do not activate missiles.</p>

  		<description>
  			<p>A Loxodon druid from the eastern savannahs of Rodethan, Ondros the Healer studies the druidic ideals of love and respect for nature. After learning all he could from his home tribe, he set off on a pilgrimage in search of the fabled druidic circle of the shepherd. Ondros spent one last night with his wife, Rena, before he departed and promised to return to her following the completion of his training. During his travels he stumbled upon the Rubicon Corporation trying to establish a loggin camp on a sacred and ancient grove. Ondros sabotaged the loggers equipment and quickly fled feeling good about saving the grove. He quickly realized that Rubicon had put a hit out on him, and that he was being hunted by mercenaries. Through luck and sheer force of will, Ondros was able to make it to the Kingdom of Kariellum. With mercenaries quick on his tail, he was forced to forgo an immediate trip to the druidic circle and sought refuge in the dwarven/gnome city of Twincrown. Unfortunately, while posing as a horse in front of a tavern, they were discovered. The hired thugs attacked, and all seemed lost. With a merry tune and an angelic voice, a halfling bard named Wayne stepped in to help. The two couldn't defeat all the mercenaries, but managed to bartered for their lives. They were thrown into an indentured servitude camp, deep below Twincrown. Over the next three months they became close with a pirate who organized an escape plan with the two. Finally free, Ondros and Wayne fled to Chinook fearing the Rubicon Corporation. Now they find themselves in Rigmoore thanks to an unusual sign you received from the Wildmother.</p>

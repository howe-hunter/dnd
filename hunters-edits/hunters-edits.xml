When an enemy gets within ten feet of you, you may target them with 1-3 missiles. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, the missile does 2d4 force damage. If the attack roll scores a critical, the missile does 5d4 force damage instead of the 4d4 force that you would normally get on a critical. If any of the attack roll is a natural one, all missiles turn around and hit the caster for 3 force damage per missile. Regains all missiles at dawn. Missiles can not trigger on your turn. Missiles only trigger when someone enters the radius, starting within the zone or teleporting in do not activate missiles.</p>

  <element name="Shifter" type="Race" source="hunters-edits" id="ID_HH_HE_RACE_SHIFTER">
		<description>
			<p>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they can’t fully change shape, they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features-a state they call shifting. Each shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</p>
			<h4>THE BEAST WITHIN</h4>
			<p>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter’s personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter’s personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>
			<p class="indent">A shifter’s beast within is reflected by the shifter’s subrace. Four subraces are especially common:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Beasthide</strong> often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn, and thick-skinned.</li>
				<li><strong>Longtooth</strong> shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>
				<li><strong>Swiftstride</strong> are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>
				<li><strong>Wildhunt</strong> shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent">While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they’ll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>
			<h4>SIMILAR AND DIVERSE</h4>
			<p>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.</p>
			<p class="indent">The traits of the beast within affect a shifter’s appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</p>
			<h4>THE JOURNEY YET TO COME</h4>
			<p>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It’s a shifter proverb to "always be prepared for the journey yet to come," and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt. A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.</p>
			<h4>SHIFTER NAMES</h4>
			<p>Shifters have no language of their own and often live in blended communities. Their names typically overlap with the names of other cultures in their region. Many shifters prefer to keep their personal names for their friends and use "wandering names" with strangers. These are usually tied to a physical or personality trait.</p>
			<p><strong>Shifter Names:</strong> Badger, Bear, Cat, Fang, Grace, Grim, Moon, Rain, Red, Scar, Stripe, Swift, Talon, Wolf</p>
			<h4>SHIFTER TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your shifter character has the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Shifters are quick to mature both physically and emotionally, reaching young adulthood at age 10. They rarely live to be more than 70 years old.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Shifters tend toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A love of personal freedom can drive shifters toward chaotic alignments.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:</p>
			<p style="margin-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">Size modifier = 2d8<br/>Height = 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches<br/>Weight in pounds = 90 + (2d4 x your size modifier)</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shifting.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You also gain additional benefits that depend on your shifter subrace, described below.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you shift, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> The beast within shapes each shifter physically and mentally. The four major subraces of shifter include: beasthide, longtooth, swiftstride, and wildhunt. Choose a subrace for your shifter.</p>

  		<description>
  			<p>A Loxodon druid from the eastern savannahs of Rodethan, Ondros the Healer studies the druidic ideals of love and respect for nature. After learning all he could from his home tribe, he set off on a pilgrimage in search of the fabled druidic circle of the shepherd. Ondros spent one last night with his wife, Rena, before he departed and promised to return to her following the completion of his training. During his travels he stumbled upon the Rubicon Corporation trying to establish a loggin camp on a sacred and ancient grove. Ondros sabotaged the loggers equipment and quickly fled feeling good about saving the grove. He quickly realized that Rubicon had put a hit out on him, and that he was being hunted by mercenaries. Through luck and sheer force of will, Ondros was able to make it to the Kingdom of Kariellum. With mercenaries quick on his tail, he was forced to forgo an immediate trip to the druidic circle and sought refuge in the dwarven/gnome city of Twincrown. Unfortunately, while posing as a horse in front of a tavern, they were discovered. The hired thugs attacked, and all seemed lost. With a merry tune and an angelic voice, a halfling bard named Wayne stepped in to help. The two couldn't defeat all the mercenaries, but managed to bartered for their lives. They were thrown into an indentured servitude camp, deep below Twincrown. Over the next three months they became close with a pirate who organized an escape plan with the two. Finally free, Ondros and Wayne fled to Chinook fearing the Rubicon Corporation. Now they find themselves in Rigmoore thanks to an unusual sign you received from the Wildmother.</p>

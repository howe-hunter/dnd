Who/What/Where

You look down the hill to see a bustling town built around the rivers feeding off of the waterfalls waters. The town is formed by an outcropping of residential homes, a lively shops, a standing marketplace, a townhall, and what looks to be a church. As you approach the towns center you get the feeling that the town is more run down than you had imagined. It seems that the small shops and stalls used to cater to tourists visiting the falls but are starting to fall apart. The shopkeeps look tired but perk up at the sight of a group of new travelers. Locals seem to be dragging themselves towards the tavern.

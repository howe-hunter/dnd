Lantern Festival
The lantern festival takes place annually on the princess's birthday. Following the princess's sacrifice for the island of Edunn king and queen valinora were nearly crippled with grief and sadness. In the hopes of lifting their spirits Relinn gathered his fellow elves and started the lantern festival. Rather than using their magic to create a lightshow (which would be an easy feat for even the most average high elf child) the elves made every lantern by hand to show their attention and honest sympathy for the grieving rulers. Every year at dusk Relinn and his successors continue to light and lift the first lantern into the air. The festival now draws many viewers and travelers looking to find luck and show their gratitude for the Valinoras and their leadership.

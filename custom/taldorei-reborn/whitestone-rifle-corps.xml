		<description>
			<p>You trained with the elite forces charged with the defense and protection of the isolated city-state of Whitestone, with much of that training focused on how to care for, protect, and safeguard the firearms that are the weapons of the Whitestone Rifle Corps. You are also entrusted with a solemn duty—to never let the secrets of your liege-lord’s deadly creations fall into the wrong hands.</p>
			<p class="indent">You might have come to Whitestone to prove yourself worthy of wielding the secretive and highly coveted firearms created there, and to seek instruction from warriors who have mastered those weapons. Or you might have grown up in Whitestone, perhaps even remembering the brutal days when Lord and Lady Briarwood ruled your homeland— a reign that began some thirty years ago and lasted for six harrowing years.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you or your parents might have come to Whitestone as refugees fleeing the destruction of the Chroma Conclave’s attack on Tal’Dorei. If so, your life in the city-state might have been a relatively peaceful one, dwelling among the engineers, artisans, and merchants seeking to capitalize upon Whitestone’s reputation as an up-and-coming center of trade, culture, and invention.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you choose this background, decide whether you were a member of the Rifle Corps, the Pale Guard, or the Whitestone Hunters. The “Whitestone” section in chapter 3 has more information about the Pale Guard, as well as the armaments and militia in the city-state. See below for more information on the Whitestone Hunters. </p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Your choice of two of the following: Athletics, Perception, or Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Firearms</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Your choice of a musket or a pistol, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Those who join the Whitestone Rifle Corps become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state’s staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you’re not at home protecting Whitestone. Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of Whitestone’s staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in Whitestone, you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your bond is likely associated with your comradesin- arms or with Whitestone itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues.</p>

				<description>
					<p>You have been entrusted with the use and care of a weapon both powerful and terrifying. The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal’Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, Percival de Rolo, manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes.</p>
					<p class="indent">You were granted a musket or a pistol (as described in the fifth edition core rules) by your commander in the Whitestone Rifle Corps. This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM’s discretion.</p>

				<description>
					<p>As elite as they are, the members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps do not represent the apex of firearms skill in Whitestone. A clandestine group of elite soldiers and survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the Whitestone Hunters, these soldiers are special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the Whitestone Hunters’ existence swirl constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to protect Whitestone’s allies. You are one of these Whitestone Hunters, even if just a trainee (if you’re starting your campaign at low levels). You have the ear of the lord and lady of Whitestone, though you must exercise this privilege graciously lest you lose it.</p>

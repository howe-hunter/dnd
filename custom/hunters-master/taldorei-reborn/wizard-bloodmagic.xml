		<description>
			<p>Considered taboo by many societies and magic practitioners, the use of blood magic—also known as hemocraft—is a rare art that harnesses the latent powers of a creature’s vitality to fuel and amplify the caster’s own capabilities, while manipulating and weakening the bodies of enemies from the inside. Some of the more macabre mages seeking to empower their arcane pursuits turn to hemocraft as a means of bolstering their spells, giving their own life’s blood to reach new heights of frightening magical prowess.</p>
			<p class="indent">The secrets of hemocraft and other forms of blood magic were once the sole purview of the mysterious Claret Orders. In recent years, however, these secrets have begun to spread beyond the order’s members and into the hands of less scrupulous mages. Blood magic has a bad reputation in Tal’Dorei, even though its powers can be used for much more than evil.</p>

			<p><em>2nd-level Blood Magic feature</em></p>
			<p>When you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you are able to use your own depleted life essence to channel your magical abilities. Whenever your current hit points are below your hit point maximum, you can use your own body as an arcane focus. In addition, when casting a wizard spell that requires a costly material component, you can forego the component by taking 1d10 necrotic damage per 50 gp of the cost of the component (minimum 1d10).</p>
			<p class="indent">This damage can’t be reduced in any way. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, the spell fails but the spell slot is not expended.</p>

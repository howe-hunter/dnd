<!-- Cataclysm Bolts -->
	<element name="Cataclysm Bolts" type="Item" source="Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn" id="ID_TALDOREI_CR_ITEM_CATACLYSM_BOLTS">
		<description>
			<p>These steel crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the Scattered War, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the Houses of Kraghammer. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect. Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
				</thead>
					<tr><td>1-2</td><td>The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>3-4</td><td>The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>5</td><td>The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>6</td><td>The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.</td></tr>

		<description>
			<p>This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies.</p>
			<p class="indent"> You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the following properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Corrosive Submission.</b></i> When you hit a creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 3d6 acid damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while it is charmed in this way, the extra acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charmed condition ends. If the target succeeds on its saving throw or the charm ends for it, it can’t be charmed again in this way for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Hidden Nature.</b></i> The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage to all who perceive it. A true seeing spell or similar magic reveals that the sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Sentience.</b> Graz’tchar</i> is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Anyone who holds it hears the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny. A creature that succeeds on a DC 26 Wisdom (Insight) check while listening to the blade’s voice hears a sliver of malice that suggests the truth: the voice is a corrupting trick of the Demon Prince of Indulgence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Personality.</b> Graz’tchar</i> slowly attempts to sway its wielder to sow chaos in Exandria, telling lies and spreading malign truths about great leaders, and claiming that the members of the Tal’Dorei Council are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the sword’s attuned wielder disobeys the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, <i>Graz’tchar</i> can attempt to control the wielder, who must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. While the wielder is charmed in this way, the sword can compel them to take an action of the sword’s choice once per hour, though the wielder believes this action is taken of their own free will. If the chosen action leads to the harm of someone the wielder considers a trusted friend or ally, the charmed condition immediately ends. On a successful saving throw or if the charmed condition ends for the wielder, they are immune to this property of the sword for 24 hours.</p>

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you have a creature grappled using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be restrained until you let go of the whip. A creature restrained in this way can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An executioner’s blade from the Age of Arcanum, this magic greatsword is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as Wildemount and Issylra, a few such blades have found their way to Tal’Dorei.</p>
			<p class="indent"> If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the dispel magic spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can use an action to cast dispel magic from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher. Once you cast dispel magic using this weapon, you can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p>

			<p>This gorgeous longbow made of everbark from the Fey Realm flexes and shifts like a living entity. It is said to have been wielded by the legendary ranger Vex’ahlia against great evils.</p>
			<p class="indent">While Fenthras is in an Exalted state, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you make an attack with Fenthras, you can declare it an oracle shot, allowing you to experience the area around the arrow using your normal senses for 10 minutes. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can declare it a bramble shot. The attack deals an extra 3d8 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or become restrained by steely brambles that burst from the arrow. A restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can declare a bramble shot twice between (long or short) rests.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when a creature is killed by an attack using this weapon, a six-foot-tall tree rapidly grows out of the corpse over the next minute. The tree is rooted in the ground to make the body difficult to move, but does not permanently damage the corpse or its organs.</p>

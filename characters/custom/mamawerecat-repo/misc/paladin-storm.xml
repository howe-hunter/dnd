        <description>
            <p>The Oath of the Storm calls to paladins who wish to harness the primal power of the storm itself. Like a storm of lightning that strikes down from above, or a whirlwind of destruction that sucks up everything in it's path, a Paladin who adheres to this oath learns to become a storm themselves. And strike down evil with a combination of flesh slicing winds, and skin frying lightning.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Tenets of the Storm</h5>
            <p>A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of the storm etched deep into their mind.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thundering Voice.</em></strong> Your voice shall be heard. And like thunder, it shall be heard by all.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Strike like Lightning.</em></strong> Be swift. Be fast. And most importantly of all, be lethal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Positive Conducting.</em></strong> Like metal conducts electricity, so do the people around you. Let your unwavering energy surge into all those around you, so they may be transformed into something greater.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eye of the Storm.</em></strong> You are the embodiment of change. Make it happen!</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Static Lightning.</em></strong> You may use a channel divinity as a reaction, anytime you are attacked with a melee attack you deal lightning damage equal to your Charisma Modifier. Any creature within 10 ft. of you that you choose also receives the damage. If the Target of the affect is wearing Full metal armor they take double the damage. At 12th Level you can add your Paladin Level to the damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Thunder Leap.</em></strong> As an action, you can choose to jump up to your movement speed in any direction. When you do this, you can choose to have lightning explode around you when you land, forcing all creatures in a 5 foot radius to make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take damage equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifier and are knocked back 10 feet or half as much on a success.</p>

            <p><em>7th-level Oath of the Storm feature</em></p>
            <p>Starting at 7th level, you may imbue a single, nonmagical melee weapon of your choice with the fury and might of your God. This process requires eight hours of uninterrupted prayer to your deity, detailing your accomplishments, why you must be granted such power, and how you are worthy of such a weapon. </p>
            <p class="indent">Upon success, lightning strikes the weapon, and becomes attuned to you, but doesn't expend an attunement slot. This weapon becomes a +2 magical weapon, and you may cast Lightning Lure through this weapon when you use an action to attack with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, this weapon gains the Thrown (range 30/120) property if it doesn't already possess it. As a bonus action, you may call your imbued weapon to you, which travels at a speed of 90 ft in a straight line, dealing 2d8 force damage to anything it encounters along its path. This damage is doubled against structures and objects. If this weapon is on another plane, it appears on your next turn as if using the Plane Shift spell in the same space as you, and returns to your hand. Anyone else attempting to wield or otherwise manipulate this weapon must succeed in a Strength check with a DC equal to your 10 + your Paladin level + your charisma modifier. On failure, the weapon is effectively too heavy to move. </p>
            <p class="indent">If your imbued weapon is destroyed, you may repeat the imbuement process. At level 15, you may imbue a Hammer of Thunderbolts or a Dwarven Thrower with these properties, ignoring the nonmagical rule. In addition, you do not need a Belt of Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Ogre Power to become attuned to a Hammer of Thunderbolts.</p>

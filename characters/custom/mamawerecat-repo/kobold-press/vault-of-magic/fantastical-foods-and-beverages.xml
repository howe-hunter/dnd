<!-- Blue Rose Tea -->
	<element name="Blue Rose Tea" type="Magic Item" source="Vault of Magic" id="ID_KBP_VOM_MAGIC_ITEM_BLUE_ROSE_TEA">
		<description>
			<p>The petals of the blue rose can be brewed into a tea. When you consume a dose of this tea, you get a glimpse into the future. This effect works like the divination spell, except the answer comes to you in visions rather than from a deity or its servants, and you can ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 14 days.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can render a dose of blue rose (see page 113) into three doses of blue rose tea with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed by 5 or more on the check, you make four doses of tea instead. On a failed check, you make only one dose of tea.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Blue Rose Addiction.</i></b> Consuming blue rose tea doesn’t cause addiction like its more potent counterpart. However, if you are addicted to blue rose, consuming one dose of this tea removes one level of exhaustion and halts the effects of the addiction for 24 hours. This effect can’t reduce your exhaustion level below 1 and can’t end the addiction.</p>

Any flammable object you touch ignites if you hold it long enough: instantly for sawdust or oil, after 1 round for sticks or dry cloth, or after 1 minute for more difficult fuel, such as damp logs or wet peat. Your footprints don’t burn the surface where you walk, and your fiery touch doesn’t harm creatures.</p>

<!--Fantastical foods and beverages are unique types of consumable magic items. They look, feel, smell, and taste like nonmagical food or beverages, but fantastical food and beverages never spoil.
To gain the benefits from a fantastical food or beverage, you must spend at least 1 minute consuming it. If you eat a fantastical food or beverage as part of a short rest and you expend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points each Hit Die restores. Each type of fantastical food or beverage also grants benefits, which you gain after consuming the food or beverage or at the end of the short rest where the food or beverage was consumed (your choice). You can gain the benefits from only one type of fantastical food or beverage at a time.

Cooking Fantastical Foods and Beverages.
Fantastical foods and beverages provide temporary benefits and work much like potions or spell scrolls—in fact, the fantastical foods and beverages listed here are categorized as potions because of this. To cook up a fantastical food or beverage during downtime, the character needs the recipe. Otherwise, treat cooking a fantastical food or beverage no differently than brewing a potion or scribing a spell scroll.-->

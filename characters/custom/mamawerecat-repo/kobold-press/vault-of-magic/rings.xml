	<element name="Clockwork Rogue Ring" type="Magic Item" source="Vault of Magic" id="ID_KBP_VOM_MAGIC_ITEM_CLOCKWORD_ROGUE_RING">
		<description>
			<p>Made by kobold clockwork mages, this brass clockwork ring is formed to look like a coiled dragon. When you speak or whisper the Draconic command word etched on the inside of the ring, the brass dragon uncoils and attempts to pick any lock within 10 feet of you. The dragon picks the lock using your proficiency bonus but with advantage. It is treated as having thieves’ tools when attempting to pick locks. It uses your Dexterity (Stealth) bonus for purposes of not being spotted but with advantage due to its extremely small size. Whether successful or not, once you have used the ring to attempt to pick a lock, it can’t be used again until the next sunset.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Made from woven lead and silver, this ring fits only on the hand’s smallest finger. As the moon is a dull reflection of the sun’s glory, so too is the power within this ring merely an imitation of the healing energies that can bestow true life. The ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These rings are made from twisted loops of gold and onyx and are always found in pairs. The rings’ magic works only while you and another humanoid of the same size each wear one ring and are on the same plane of existence. While wearing a ring, you or the other humanoid can use an action to swap your appearances, if both of you are willing. This effect works like the Change Appearance effect of the alter self spell, except you can change your appearance to only look identical to each other. Your clothing and equipment don’t change, and the effect lasts until one of you uses this property again or until one of you removes the ring.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This stylized silver ring is favored by spellcasters accustomed to fighting creatures capable of shrugging off most spells. The ring has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has only one target and the target succeeds on the saving throw, you can use a reaction and expend 1 charge from the ring to change the spell’s target to a new target within the spell's range. The new target is then affected by the spell, but the new target has advantage on the saving throw. You can’t move the spell more than once this way, even if the new target succeeds on the saving throw. You can’t move a spell that affects an area, that has multiple targets, that requires an attack roll, or that allows the target to make a saving throw to reduce, but not prevent, the effects of the spell, such as blight or feeblemind.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This polished brass ring has 3 charges. While wearing the ring, you are inspired to daring acts that risk life and limb, especially if such acts would impress or intimidate others who witness them. When you choose a course of action that could result in serious harm or possible death (your GM has final say in if an action qualifies), you can expend 1 of the ring’s charges to roll a d10 and add the number rolled to any d20 roll you make to achieve success or avoid damage, such as a Strength (Athletics) check to scale a sheer cliff and avoid falling or a Dexterity saving throw made to run through a hallway filled with swinging blades.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ring regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, if you fail on a roll boosted by the ring, and you failed the roll by only 1, the ring regains 1 expended charge, as its magic recognizes a valiant effort.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This ring stores hit points sacrificed to it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 30 hit points at a time. When found, it contains 2d10 stored hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing this ring, you can use an action to spend one or more Hit Dice, up to your maximum Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the ring stores the total, up to 30 hit points. This hit point maximum reduction can’t be removed with the greater restoration spell or similar magic and lasts as long as hit points remain stored in the ring. You can’t store hit points in the ring if you don’t have blood. When hit points are stored in the ring, you can cause one of the following effects:</p>
			<p class="indent">• You can use a bonus action to remove stored hit points from the ring and regain that number of hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">• You can use an action to remove stored hit points from the ring while touching the ring to a creature. If you do so, the creature regains hit points equal to the amount of hit points you removed from the ring.</p>
			<p class="indent">• When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can use a reaction to empty the ring of stored hit points and regain hit points equal to that amount.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hit Dice spent on this ring’s features can’t be used to regain hit points during a short rest. You regain spent Hit Dice as normal.</p>

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, if the target fails three consecutive saving throws, the chains bind the target permanently. A successful dispel magic (DC 17) cast on the chains destroys them.</p>

			<p>A pale chrysoprase cut into the shape of a frog is the centerpiece of this tarnished copper ring. While wearing this ring, you have a swimming speed of 20 feet, and you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Frog Tongue.</i></b> You can use an action transform your tongue into one resembling that of a frog or toad for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You can elongate your tongue out to a distance of 20 feet, and your tongue can pick up or hold an object weighing no more than 10 pounds. To grab an item that is being worn or carried, you must still succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, ranged attack, or similar check, as determined by your GM. The tongue retracts into your mouth when not in use and has no impact on your ability to speak or cast spells with verbal components. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

			<p>This ring is crafted of silver with an inlay of mother-of-pearl.

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Bestow Shimmer.</i></b> While wearing the ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to charge a weapon you wield with silvery energy until the start of your next turn.

			<p>This heavy, gold ring is set with a round piece of carnelian, which is engraved with the symbol of an eagle perched upon a crown. While wearing the ring, you have advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects. You can use an action to touch the ring to a creature—requiring a melee attack roll unless the creature is willing or incapacitated—and magically brand it with the ring’s crest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a branded creature harms you, it takes 2d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature is immune to this property of the ring for the next 24 hours, but the brand remains until removed. You can remove the brand as an action. The remove curse spell also removes the brand. Once you brand a creature, you can’t brand another creature until the next dawn. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Instruments of Law.</i></b> If you are also attuned to and wearing a Justicar’s mask (see page 149), you can cast the locate creature to detect a branded creature at will from the ring.

<!-- Voidwalker -->
	<element name="Voidwalker" type="Magic Item" source="Vault of Magic" id="ID_KBP_VOM_MAGIC_ITEM_VOIDWALKER">
		<description>
			<p>This band of tarnished silver bears no ornament or inscription, but it is icy cold to the touch. The patches of dark corrosion on the ring constantly, but subtly, move and change; though, this never occurs while anyone observes the ring.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing Voidwalker, you gain the benefits of a ring of free action (While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be paralyzed or restrained) and a ring of resistance (cold). It has the following additional properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Forbidden Lore.</i></b> Voidwalker knows a great deal about esoteric and dark topics, and grants you the following skill modifiers: Arcana +8, History +8, Religion +8.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Necrotic Absorption.</i></b> When you would take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to absorb the damage instead. You regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage you would have otherwise taken.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Void Step.</i></b> You can use the ring to cast misty step at will. Instead of a puff of mist, you fade and reappear in a black smear in the air.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> Voidwalker is a sentient neutral evil ring with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The ring communicates telepathically with its wearer and can also speak Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Void Speech. It constantly whispers suggestions for its wearer to find new pathways to the Void, often as a means to solve any problem or dilemma the wearer faces.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Personality.</i></b> Voidwalker is an obsequious thing that takes great pains to cater to the desires of its wearer. It comports itself as an advisor, majordomo, or other high-ranking servant. In truth, its purpose is to return to the Void and to take a mortal “master” with it. Conflict arises if its wearer tries to seal a breach or gateway into the Void or to discard the ring. </p>
			<p class="indent">The ring is clever and knows that most mortals want nothing to do with the Void directly. It also knows that most of the creatures with strength enough to claim it will end up in dire straits sooner or later. It doesn’t overplay its hand trying to push a master to take a plunge into the depths of the Void, but instead makes itself as indispensable as possible. It provides counsel and protection, all the while subtly pushing its master to take greater and greater risks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once it’s maneuvered its wearer into a position of desperation, generally on the brink of death, Voidwalker offers a way out. If the master accepts, it opens a gate into the Void, most likely sealing the creature’s doom.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This plain gold ring features a magnificent ruby. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cause a crimson zipline of magical force to extend from the gem in the ring and attach to up to two solid surfaces you can see. Each surface must be within 150 feet of you. Once the zipline is connected, you can use a bonus action to magically travel up to 50 feet along the line between the two surfaces. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the zipline is active, you remain suspended within 5 feet of the line, floating off the ground at least 3 inches, and you can’t move more than 5 feet away from the zipline. When you magically travel along the line, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks. The hand wearing the ring must be pointed at the line when you magically travel along it, but you otherwise can act normally while the zipline is active. You can use a bonus action to end the zipline.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the zipline has been active for a total of 1 minute, the ring’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.</p>

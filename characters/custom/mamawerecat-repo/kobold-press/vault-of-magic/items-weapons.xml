		<description>
			<p>The handle of this simple flail is made of smooth lotus wood. The three threshers are made of carved and painted wooden beads. You gain a + 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>True Authority (Requires Attunement).</i></b> You must be attuned to a Crook of the Flock (rod) to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you are no longer attuned to the crook. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Charisma score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you hit a beast with this weapon, the beast takes an extra 3d6 bludgeoning damage. For the purpose of this weapon, “beast” refers to any creature with the beast type. </p>
			<p class="indent">The flail also has 5 charges. When you reduce a humanoid to 0 hit points with an attack from this weapon, you can expend 1 charge. If you do so, the humanoid stabilizes, regains 1 hit point, and is charmed by you for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the humanoid regards you as its trusted leader, but it otherwise retains its statistics and regains hit points as normal. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, the target ceases to be charmed in this way. The flail regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. As an action, you can swing the sickle to cut nonmagical vegetation up to 60 feet away from you. Each cut is a separate action with one action equaling one swing of your arm. Thus, you can lead a party through a jungle or briar thicket at a normal pace, simply swinging the sickle back and forth ahead of you to clear the path. It can’t be used to cut trunks of saplings larger than 1 inch in diameter. It also can’t cut through unliving wood (such as a door or wall). When you hit a plant creature with a melee attack with this weapon, that target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. This weapon can make very precise cuts, such as to cut fruit or flowers high up in a tree without damaging the tree.</p>

If the hour elapses and you haven’t sated its thirst for blood, the dagger deals 14 slashing damage to you. If the dagger deals damage to you as a result of the curse, you can’t heal the damage for 24 hours.</p>
			 <p class="indent">The remove curse spell removes your attunement to the item and frees you from the curse. Alternatively, casting the banishment spell on the dagger forces the bearded devil’s essence to leave it. The scalpel then becomes a +1 dagger with no other properties.</p>

			<p>From a distance, this weapon bears a passing resemblance to a fallen tree branch. This unique polearm was first crafted by a famed martial educator and military general from the collected weapons of his fallen compatriots. Each point on this branching spear has a history of its own and is infused with the pain of loss and the glory of military service. When wielded in battle, each of the small, branching spear points attached to the polearm’s shaft pulses with a warm glow and burns with the desire to protect the righteous. When not using it, you can fold the branches inward and sheathe the polearm in a leather wrap.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you hold this weapon, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. You can fold and wrap the weapon as an action, extinguishing the light. While holding or carrying the weapon, you have resistance to piercing damage.The weapon has 10 charges for the following other properties. The weapon regains 1d8 + 2 charges daily at dawn. In addition, it regains 1 charge when exposed to powerful magical sunlight, such as the light created by the sunbeam and sunburst spells, and it regains 1 charge each round it remains exposed to such sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spike Barrage.</i></b> While wielding this weapon, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges and sweep the weapon in a small arc to release a barrage of spikes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 piercing damage for each charge you expend on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spiked Wall.</i></b> While wielding this weapon, you can use an action to expend 6 charges to cast the wall of thorns spell (save DC 17) from it.</p>

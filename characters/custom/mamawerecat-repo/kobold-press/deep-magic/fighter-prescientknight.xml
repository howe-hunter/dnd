			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from among guidance, quicken, and true strike. You learn the remaining cantrip of the three at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Prescient Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice, all of which you must choose from the divination and temporal spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Prescient Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. You learn additional spells as you progress; newly learned spells have the same school and list restrictions as your original spells. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one spell you know with another from among those spells you are able to learn. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

Additionally, using your Action Surge in this way allows you to give sufficient warning to allies who are within 15 feet of you, so they can also start taking reactions after your turn.</p>

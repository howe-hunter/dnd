You can make minor alterations to the scene being played out, becoming visible for an instant each time you make an adjustment that aids an ally or hinders foes. To everyone else, you disappear when the spell is cast, then flicker into and out of view during the next round, before reappearing for good in the space you vanished from 1 round later, whereupon the spell ends. You cannot be attacked by any means while under the effect of this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">As the round progresses, you can choose to bestow a single effect on each creature involved in the combat, choosing from the list below. You cannot take any other actions during the round.</p>
			<p class="indent">-Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw it is about to make.</p>
			<p class="indent">-Give a creature advantage or disadvantage on an attack roll it is about to make.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You capture a creature within range in a loop of time. The target is teleported to the space where it began its most recent turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature must repeat the activities it undertook on its previous turn, following the sequence of moves and actions to the best of its ability. It doesn’t need to move along the same path or attack the same target, but if it moved and then attacked on its previous turn, its only option is to move and then attack on this turn. If the space where the target began its previous turn is occupied or if it’s impossible for the target to take the same action (if it cast a spell but is now unable to do so, for example), the target becomes incapacitated.</p>
			<p class="indent">An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For as long as the spell lasts, the target teleports back to its starting point at the start of each of its turns, and it must repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.</p>

			<p>You ensnare a creature within range in an insidious trap, causing different parts of its body to function at different speeds. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with the same effects for success and failure. In addition, the creature has disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws but advantage on Constitution or Charisma saving throws for the spell’s duration (a side effect of the chronal anomaly suffusing its body). The spell ends if the creature makes three successful saves in a row.</p>

			<p>You protect a book by writing a curse in it with ink made from the material components of this spell.

When the curse is triggered, the creature that did so must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer its effect. You can choose one of the effects described in the bestow curse spell, or you can affect the target in one of the following ways:</p>
			<p class="indent"> •While the target is cursed, it is blinded.</p>
			<p class="indent"> •Beasts are unusually hostile to the target while it is cursed; they gain advantage on attack rolls against the target.</p>
			<p class="indent"> •While cursed, the target is an attractive mark to pickpockets and other thieves, and such individuals will try to steal the target’s valuables when the opportunity presents itself. (Even if in the target’s possession, the cursed book does not count as one of the target’s valuables.)</p>
			<p class="indent"> •A cursed target that either receives magical healing or rolls Hit Dice to recover hit points after a long rest must roll twice and use the lower result.</p>
			<p class="indent">A remove curse spell ends this effect. You can also stipulate other actions taken by the target that would nullify the curse (returning the book after it is stolen, for example).</p>

			<p>	You elevate your body to a higher form. When you cast the spell, choose three of the forms described below and indicate which one’s effects will occur first. While the spell lasts, you can use a bonus action to exchange one of your choices for an unused one, or to make a new choice when the current one ends. The spell ends when its duration expires or when you expend all the available uses of the third form you adopt.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Wings.</i></b> You sprout wings from your shoulders and gain a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings can be batlike or feathered.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Breath Weapon.</i></b> You gain a breath weapon of one of these types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can use an action to unleash your breath weapon in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 8d6 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. The breath weapon is considered a magical attack. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Limbs.</i></b> Appendages resembling tentacles, spider legs, pincers, or something else of your choosing sprout from your body. Choose slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage; you can use an action to make two melee weapon attacks with your new limbs, and each attack deals 2d12 damage of the chosen type. You are proficient with these weapons, and they have the reach and finesse properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Radiating Light.</i></b> You emit light in a 10-foot radius. The light can come from a halo, from ghostly flames, from your eyes, or any other source you choose. The light deals your choice of necrotic, fire, or radiant damage. A creature that passes through the light on its turn or that ends its turn in the light takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Regeneration.</i></b> You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Overwhelming Might.</i></b> When you hit a target with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Frightening Presence.</i></b> As an action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you. Each of them must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your frightening presence for the next 24 hours. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You cause the glint of a golden coin to haze over the vision of one creature in range. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it sees a gorge, trench, or other hole in the ground, at a spot within range chosen by you, which is filled with gold and treasure. On its next turn, the creature must move toward that spot. When it reaches the spot, it becomes incapacitated, as it devotes all its attention to scooping imaginary treasure into its pockets or a pouch.</p>
			<p class="indent">An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature takes damage from you or one of your allies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on the initial saving throw but have advantage on saving throws against this spell made after reaching the designated spot.</p>

<!-- TRIUMPH OF ICE --> 
	<element name="Triumph of Ice" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_TRIUMP_OF_ICE">
		<supports>Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You transform one of the four elements—air, earth, fire, or water—into ice or snow. The affected area is a sphere with a radius of 100 feet, centered on you. The specific effect depends on the element you choose.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Air.</i></b> Vapor condenses into snowfall. If the effect of a fog cloud spell, a stinking cloud, or similar magic is in the area, this spell negates it. A creature of elemental air within range takes 8d6 cold damage—and, if airborne, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn to avoid being knocked prone (no falling damage).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Earth.</i></b> Soil freezes into permafrost to a depth of 10 feet. A creature burrowing through the area has its speed halved until the area thaws, unless it can burrow through solid rock. A creature of elemental earth within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fire.</i></b> Flames or other sources of extreme heat (such as molten lava) on the ground within range transform into shards of ice, and the area they occupy becomes difficult terrain. Each creature in the previously burning area takes 2d6 slashing damage when the spell is cast and 1d6 slashing damage for every 5 feet it moves in the area (unless it is not hindered by icy terrain) until the spell ends; a successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the slashing damage by half. A creature of elemental fire within range must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 cold damage and be stunned for 1d6 rounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Water.</i></b> Open water (a pond, lake, or river) freezes to a depth of 4 feet. A creature on the surface of the water when it freezes must make a successful Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength (Athletics) check. A creature of elemental water within range takes no damage from the spell but is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw, and it treats the affected area as difficult terrain.</p>

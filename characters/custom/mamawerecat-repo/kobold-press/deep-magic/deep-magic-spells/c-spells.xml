			<p>You conjure a shadow mastiff from the plane of shadow. This creature obeys your verbal commands to aid you in battle or to seek out a specific creature. It has the body of a large dog with a smooth black coat, 2 feet high at the shoulder and weighing 200 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">The mastiff is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the mastiff; it acts on its own turn. It obeys simple, verbal commands from you, within its ability to act. Giving a command takes no action on your part.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Candle’s insight is cast on its target as the component candle is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully. An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily through even an outrageously false statement, as long as the target believes it’s true.</p>
			<p class="indent">Candle’s insight is used across society: by merchants while negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.</p>

			<p>At your command, delicious fruit jam oozes from a small mechanical device (such as a crossbow trigger, a lock, or a clockwork toy), rendering the device inoperable until the spell ends and the device is cleaned with a damp cloth. Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has no effect until the spell ends. One serving of the jam can be collected in a suitable container. If it's eaten (as a bonus action) within 24 hours, the jam restores 1d4 hit points. The jam's flavor is determined by the material component.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations. First, the target creature negates the effect with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the construct is Tiny, only one component (an eye, a knee, an elbow, and so forth) can be disabled. The affected construct has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that depend on the disabled component until the spell ends and the jam is removed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts.</p>
			<p class="indent">The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each slot level above 7th.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ritual Focus.</i></b> If you expend your ritual focus, an unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has previously succeeded on a save against the spell. Also, once you've expended your ritual focus this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1 round per caster level.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has 17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71 hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get 50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum Hit Dice of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It makes a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it or if you are not the same species as the target. If the saving throw fails, the targeted humanoid becomes quite fond of you until the duration expires or until you or any of your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a potential romantic partner and seeks to attract you in whatever manner is most appropriate to it. It might tell you jokes or clown around, give you a (modest) gift, flirt gently, flex its muscles and demonstrate its athletic prowess, or compose a love poem to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them. If two or more creatures fail their saving throws, they fall to bickering between themselves over who is more worthy of your affection.</p>

<!-- CLOAK OF SERPENTS  -->
	4th-level abjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Self 
	Components: V, S, M (a snake scale) 
	Duration: 10 minutes 
	A mass of writhing, translucent snakes drapes your body, protecting you from harm and fending off enemies. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. 
	For the duration of the spell, you gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, that creature is struck by one of the serpents. The attacker takes 2d8 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the poisoned effect.

<!-- CLOAK OF VERMIN  -->
	3rd-level conjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Self 
	Components: V, S, M (a handful of dead flies) 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
	You conjure a writhing garment of living insects that protect you and harm your foes. While the spell is active, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the insects lash out, dealing 2d4 piercing damage to the attacker. 
	As a bonus action, you can command your cloak to leave your body, becoming a swarm of insects, and enter the space of an adjacent foe. The swarm attacks that foe until you use a bonus action to command it to return to you, the foe moves more than 5 feet away from you, the spell ends, or the swarm dies. You lose the protective benefit of the cloak when using it in this fashion.

		<description>
			<p>You imbue an arrow or crossbow bolt with clockwork magic just as you fire it at your target; spinning blades materialize on the missile after it strikes to further mutilate your enemy.</p>
			<p class="indent">As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with a bow or a crossbow against one creature within range. If the attack hits, the missile embeds in the target. Unless the target (or an ally of it within 5 feet) uses an action to remove the projectile (which deals no additional damage), the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage at the end of its next turn from spinning blades that briefly sprout from the missile’s shaft. Afterward, the projectile reverts to normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell deals more damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d8 slashing damage to the target, and the target takes an additional 1d8 slashing damage (2d8 total) if the embedded ammunition isn’t removed. Both damage amounts increase by 1d8 again at 11th level and at 17th level.</p>

<!-- CLOSING IN  -->
	3rd-level illusion 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, S 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
	Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes with disadvantage if it’s in an enclosed space. On a failed save, the creature believes the world around it is closing in and threatening to crush it. Even in open or clear terrain, the creature feels as though it is sinking into a pit, or that the land is rising around it. The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration, and it takes 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

<!-- CLUMSINESS  -->
	Necromancy cantrip 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, S 
	Duration: 1 minute 
	You temporarily make a creature within range less dexterous. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Dexterity check before the spell ends, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.

<!-- COBRA FANGS  -->
	1st-level transmutation 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Touch 
	Components: V, S, M (a drop of snake venom or a patch of snakeskin) 
	Duration: 1 minute 
	The spell causes the target to grow great, snake-like fangs. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell fails if the target already has a bite attack that deals poison damage. 
	If the target doesn’t have a bite attack, it gains one. The target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4. 
	When the target hits a creature with its bite attack, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target’s bite counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

<!-- COMMAND UNDEAD  -->
	3rd-level necromancy 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 60 feet 
	Components: V 
	Duration: Concentration 
	You speak a one-word command to all undead creatures you can see within range. Any target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is living, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

<!-- COMPELLED MOVEMENT  -->
	3rd-level enchantment 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 60 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (the embalmed body of a millipede with its right legs removed, worth at least 50 gp) 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
	Choose two living creatures (not constructs or undead) you can see within range. Each must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is compelled to use its movement to move toward the other creature. Its route must be as direct as possible, but it avoids dangerous terrain and enemies. If the creatures are within 5 feet of each other at the end of either one’s turn, their bodies fuse together. Fused creatures still take their own turns, but they can’t move, can’t use reactions, and have disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity saving throws, and Constitution checks to maintain concentration. 
	A fused creature can use its action to make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and can move as it wants. It can become fused again, however, if it’s within 5 feet of a creature that’s still under the spell’s effect at the end of either creature’s turn. 
	Compelled movement doesn’t affect a creature that can’t be charmed or that is incorporeal. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of creatures you can affect increases by one for every two slot levels above 3rd. 
	
<!-- COMPELLING FATE  -->
	3rd-level divination 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, M (a sprinkling of silver dust worth 20 gp) 
	Duration: 1 round 
	You view the actions of a single creature you can see through the influence of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the following effects: 
		You have advantage on attack rolls against the target. 
		For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn’s movement. 
		As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack. 
		<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.

<!-- COMPREHEND WILD SHAPE  -->
	2nd-level divination 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Touch 
	Components: V, S, M (two or more matching carved totems) 
	Duration: 1 hour 
	Give one of the carved totems to an ally while keeping the other yourself. For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn’t a telepathic link; you simply understand each other’s verbal communication, similar to the effect of a speak with animals spell. This effect doesn’t allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the number of target creatures by two for each slot level above 2nd. Each creature must receive a matching carved totem.

		<description>
			<p>This spell befuddles the minds of up to six creatures that you can see within range, causing the creatures to see images of shifting terrain. Each target that fails an Intelligence saving throw is reduced to half speed until the spell ends because of confusion over its surroundings, and it makes ranged attack rolls with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Affected creatures also find it impossible to keep track of their location. They automatically fail Wisdom (Survival) checks to avoid getting lost. Whenever an affected creature must choose between one or more paths, it chooses at random and immediately forgets which direction it came from.</p>

<!-- CONJURE FEY HOUND  -->

	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 60 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (a wooden or metal whistle) 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
	You summon a fey hound to fight by your side. A hound of the night (Tome of Beasts, p. 251) appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 
	The summoned hound is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned hound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the hound, it stands by your side and attacks nearby creatures that are hostile to you but otherwise takes no actions.

<!-- CONJURE FOREST DEFENDER  -->
	6th-level conjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 hour 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (one humanoid body, which the spell consumes) 
	Duration: Until destroyed 
	When you cast this spell in a forest, you fasten sticks and twigs around a body. The body comes to life as a forest defender (see below). The forest defender is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the forest defender, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal or mental commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as you remain within its line of sight. If you don’t issue any commands to the forest defender, if you are out of its line of sight, or if you are unconscious, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. A body sacrificed to form the forest defender is permanently destroyed and can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. You can have only one forest defender under your control at a time. If you cast this spell again, the previous forest defender crumbles to dust. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you summon two forest defenders instead of one, and you can control up to two forest defenders at a time.

<!-- CONJURE GREATER SPECTRAL DEAD  -->
	7th-level conjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 minute 
	Range: 60 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (a handful of bone dust, a crystal prism worth at least 100 gp, and a platinum coin) 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 
	You summon an incorporeal undead creature that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. You choose one of the following options for what appears: 
		One wraith 
		One spectral guardian (Tome of Beasts, p. 358) 
		One swarm of wolf spirits (Tome of Beasts, p. 377) 

	Summoned creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 
	The summoned creature doesn’t attack you or your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. The creature attacks your enemies and tries to stay within 60 feet of you, but it otherwise controls its own actions. The summoned creature despises being bound and might harm or impede you and your companions by any means at its disposal other than direct attacks if the opportunity arises. At the beginning of the creature’s turn, you can use your reaction to verbally command it. The creature obeys your commands for that turn, and you take 1d6 psychic damage at the end of the turn. If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you can no longer command it, it becomes hostile to you and your companions, and it attacks you and your allies if it believes it has a chance to win the fight or to inflict meaningful harm; otherwise it flees. You can’t dismiss the uncontrolled creature, but it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you summon a deathwisp (Tome of Beasts, p. 72) or two ghosts instead. 

<!-- CONJURE MANTELET --> 
	2nd-level abjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Self

<!-- CONJURE MOCK ANIMALS --> 
	1st-level conjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, S 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
	You summon fey spirits that take the outward appearance of animals, but merely to serve as a distraction and trap for the unwary. The spell functions as conjure animals, but each mock animal has only 1 hit point and deals only 1 damage on a hit regardless of its appearance. 
	When a mock animal is dropped to 0 hit points, it explodes in a flash of light, dealing 2d4 radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Each creature that takes damage must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded for 1 round.

<!-- CONSULT THE STORM  -->
	4th-level divination 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 90 feet 
	Components: V 
	Duration: Instantaneous 
	You ask a question of an entity connected to storms, such as an elemental, a deity, or a primal spirit, and the entity replies with destructive fury. 
	As part of the casting of the spell, you must speak a question consisting of fifteen words or fewer. Choose a point within range. A short, truthful answer to your question booms from that point. It can be heard clearly by any creature within 600 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the point takes 7d6 thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

<!-- CONTROL ICE  -->
	<element name="Control Ice" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_CONTROL_ICE">
		<supports>Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Until the spell ends, you control any ice inside an area you choose within range that can be as large as a cube 100 feet on a side. You choose one of the following three effects when you cast this spell. As an action on each of your turns thereafter, you can use the same effect or choose a different one. Any alterations made to the ice remain after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects (temperature, seismic action, or another application of this spell, for example).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Crack</i></b>. You cause ice in the area to crack and splinter. On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Reshape.</i></b> You cause ice in a portion of the area to rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape you command. You can block holes, open tunnels, form bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the form of the ice in the area. You can cause ice to become slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove difficult terrain. You can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube, or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a chasm, or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet square). You can continue this action on consecutive rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you maintain concentration on the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Thicken/Thin.</i></b> You cause existing ice to increase or decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on.</p>

<!-- CONVOLUTED DICTUM  -->
	2nd-level enchantment 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 60 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (a long, twisted piece of red ribbon) 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
	You manipulate the thinking of a creature within range, compelling it to take longer, more elaborate means to complete actions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take only one action or bonus action on its turn until the spell ends. 
	If the target tries to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t do so, the spell is wasted. If the target interacts with an object while taking its action, such as drawing a sword as part of an attack, it must also roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, it must make the interaction with the object its sole action on that round, taking the Use An Object action. In the example given, the target would take its action drawing the sword with an extensive amount of flourish or drama and be unable to attack with it until its next turn. 
	At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.

<!-- COSTLY VICTORY  -->
	8th-level evocation 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 90 feet 
	Components: V, S 
	Duration: 1 hour 
	You select up to ten enemies you can see that are within range. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature is cursed to burst into flame if it reduces one of your allies to 0 hit points before this spell’s duration expires. The affected creature takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 radiant damage when it bursts into flame. 
	If the affected creature is wearing flammable material (or is made of flammable material, such as a plant creature), it catches on fire and continues burning; the creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.

It reverts form, changing back into the rings used to cast the spell, when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ring servant is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the ring servant, which acts on its own turns.

<!-- CREATE THUNDERSTAFF  -->
	7th-level transmutation 
	Casting Time: 10 minutes 
	Range: Touch 
	Components: V, S, M (a quarterstaff) 
	Duration: Instantaneous 
	After you cast create thunderstaff on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound. 
	After 60 days, the staff is fully charged and can’t absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a thunderstaff, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a thunderwave spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged. 
	If the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.

			<p>You create a great, writhing mass of shadows that move slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range. The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling.</p>
			<p class="indent">All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself from the tendrils.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 5-foot cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as at least one 5-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature’s space, the creature remains restrained.</p>

	Components: V, S, M (a piece of spoiled food) 
	Duration: 5 days 
	You cast a curse on a creature within range that you’re familiar with, causing it to be unsatiated by food no matter how much it eats. This effect isn’t merely an issue of perception; the target physically can’t draw sustenance from food. Within minutes after the spell is cast, the target feels constant hunger no matter how much food it consumes. The target must make a Constitution saving throw 24 hours after the spell is cast and every 24 hours thereafter. On a failed save, the target gains one level of exhaustion. The effect ends when the duration expires or when the target makes two consecutive successful saves. 

<!-- CURSE OF HOSTILITY  -->
	3rd-level necromancy 
	Casting Time: 1 action

	Components: V, S 
	Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 
	You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed with the antipathy of a certain type of creature, chosen by you when you cast the spell. Choose from one of the following: aberrations, beasts, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, plants, or undead. In situations involving creatures of the selected type, the following effects apply. 
		In encounters with creatures of the selected type when the creatures are already hostile, they will attack the target of this spell in preference to other targets. 
		A creature of the selected type gains advantage on any attack rolls made against the target if the target has attacked and hit that creature at least once during the encounter. 
		The target has disadvantage on any Charisma-based checks made against creatures of the chosen type. 

	A remove curse spell ends this effect. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 24 hours.

If the target fails on an Intelligence saving throw, roll a d4 and refer to the following table to determine what the target does on its turn. An affected target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or applying the result of another roll on the table on a failure. 
	D4 	RESULT 
	1 	Target spends its turn shouting mocking words at caster and takes a -5 penalty to its initiative roll. 
	2 	Target stands transfixed and blinking, takes no action. 
	3 	Target flees or fights (50 percent chance of each). 
	4 	Target charges directly at caster, enraged. 

<!-- CURSE OF THE GRAVE --> 
	7th-level necromancy 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 120 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt from a freshly dug grave) 
	Duration: Until dispelled 
	You tap your connection to death to curse a humanoid, making the grim pull of the grave stronger on that creature’s soul. 
	Choose one humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed. A remove curse spell or similar magic ends this curse. While cursed in this way, the target suffers the following effects: 
		The target fails death saving throws on any roll but a 20. 
		If the target dies while cursed, it rises 1 round later as a vampire spawn under your control and is no longer cursed. 
		The target, as a vampire spawn, seeks you out in an attempt to serve its new master. You can have only one vampire spawn under your control at a time through this spell. If you create another, the existing one turns to dust. If you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it is no longer under your control. 

<!-- CURSE OF YIG  -->
	<element name="Curse of Yig" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_CURSE_OF_YIG">
		<supports>Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell transforms a Small, Medium, or Large creature that you can see within range into a servant of Yig (Creature Codex, p. 325). An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom saving throw, negating the effect with a success. A willing creature is automatically affected and remains so for as long as you maintain concentration on the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The target’s statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a servant of Yig. The transformed creature’s alignment becomes neutral evil, and it is both friendly to you and reverent toward the Father of Serpents. Its equipment is unchanged. If the transformed creature was unwilling, it makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends, the creature’s alignment and personality return to normal, and it regains its former attitude toward you and toward Yig.</p>
			<p class="indent">When it reverts to its normal form, the creature has the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.</p>

<!-- CURSE RING  -->

		<supports>Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You lay a curse upon a ring you touch that isn’t being worn or carried. When you cast this spell, select one of the possible effects of bestow curse. The next creature that willingly wears the ring suffers the chosen effect with no saving throw. The curse transfers from the ring to the wearer once the ring is put on; the ring becomes a mundane ring that can be taken off, but the curse remains on the creature that wore the ring until the curse is removed or dispelled. An identify spell cast on the cursed ring reveals the fact that it is cursed.</p>

<!-- CURSED GIFT  -->
	4th-level abjuration 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: Touch 
	Components: V, S, M (an object worth at least 75 gp) 
	Duration: 24 hours 
	Cursed gift imbues an object with a harmful magical effect that you or another creature in physical contact with you is currently suffering from. If you give this object to a creature that freely accepts it during the duration of the spell, the recipient must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the harmful effect is transferred to the recipient for the duration of the spell (or until the effect ends).		
	Returning the object to you, destroying it, or giving it to someone else has no effect. Remove curse and comparable magic can relieve the individual who received the item, but the harmful effect still returns to the previous victim when this spell ends if the effect’s duration has not expired. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 24 hours for each slot level above 4th. 
	
<!-- CYNOPHOBIA  -->
	3rd-level enchantment 
	Casting Time: 1 action 
	Range: 30 feet 
	Components: V, S, M (a dog’s tooth) 
	Duration: 8 hours 
	Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or develop an overriding fear of canids, such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and worgs. For the duration, the first time the target sees a canid, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of that canid until the end of its next turn. Each time the target sees a different canid, it must make the saving throw. In addition, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while a canid is within 10 feet of it. 
	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 24 hours. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 month. When you use a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

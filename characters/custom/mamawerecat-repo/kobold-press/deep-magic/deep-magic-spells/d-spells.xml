			<p>You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A dark shadow creeps across the target’s mind and leaves a small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or darkness, the creature must either move toward bright light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a light spell, or the like).</p>

		<description>
			<p>You infuse yourself with fiendish power, which inspires your allies and intimidates your foes. While the spell lasts, you exude confidence. You gain advantage on saving throws against all enchantment spells and effects. In addition, each ally within 30 feet of you can roll a d4 once per round and add the result to an attack roll as a bonus action, or to a saving throw as a reaction.</p>
			<p class="indent">An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of you, or that moves within 30 feet of you on its turn, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. If a creature moves out of the spell’s radius, it remains frightened until the start of its next turn, and then the spell ends for that creature. While frightened in this way, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened, and it cannot be affected again by your casting of this spell for 24 hours.</p>

		<supports>Druid,Paladin,Ranger,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard,Temporal</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You slow the flow of time around a creature within range that you can see. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or its walking speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Until the spell ends, on a failed save the target’s speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. For example, if a creature with a speed of 30 feet fails its initial saving throw, its speed drops to 15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature’s speed drops to 10 feet on a failed save, then to 5 feet on the  following round on another failed save. Decelerate can’t reduce a creature’s speed to less than 5 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect an additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

	<element name="Deep Freeze" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_DEEP_FREEZE">
		<supports>Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You send a blast of deep cold at a creature, dealing 4d8 cold damage to it and encasing it in ice. An encased creature is grappled and takes an extra 2d8 cold damage at the start of its turn every round it remains encased. If the target of this spell makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it takes half the damage and none of the extra damage and is not encased in ice, but the ice that clings to its body reduces its speed by 15 feet (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) until it takes an action to remove the ice.</p>
			<p class="indent">A grappled target can take an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, breaking free of the ice on a success. Alternatively, another creature within 5 feet of the target can make a Strength check on its turn, freeing the creature on a success. The ice can also be attacked. It has AC 12, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. You must consume the potion within 1 round of casting delay potion; otherwise the spell has no effect. At any point during delay potion’s duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated, it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is delayed, it has no effect at all and you can consume and benefit from other potions normally.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal effect when you drink it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>	One humanoid of your choice within range becomes a gateway for a demon to enter the plane of existence you are on. You choose the demon’s type from among those of challenge rating of 4 or lower. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the gateway fails to open, and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 force damage from the demon’s attempt to claw its way through the gate. For the spell’s duration, you can use a bonus action to further agitate the demon, dealing an additional 2d6 force damage to the target each time.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target drops to 0 hit points while affected by this spell, the demon tears through the body and appears in the same space as its now incapacitated or dead victim. You do not control this demon; it is free to either attack or leave the area as it chooses. The demon disappears after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by desolation.</p>
			<p class="indent">After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.</p>
			<p class="indent">A living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can detect the presence of dragons and other draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120 feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover depends on the number of consecutive rounds you spend an action studying a subject or area. On the first round of examination, you detect whether any draconic creatures are present, but not their number, location, identity, or type. On the second round, you learn the number of such creatures as well as the general condition of the most powerful one. On the third and subsequent rounds, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds, you learn the age, type, and location of one draconic creature. Note that the spell provides no information on the turn in which it is cast, unless you have the means to take a second action that turn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A wave of withering darkness erupts from you, filling a 120-foot-radius sphere and extinguishing any nonmagical light sources in the area. Any light produced by spells of 6th level or lower is dispelled. Magic items (but not artifacts) that give off light have that property suppressed while in the spell’s area. Any light sources brought into the area during the spell’s duration are likewise extinguished. Light-producing spells of 7th level or higher function within the area.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nonmagical light sources removed from the area can be reignited. Magic items regain their ability to give off light 1 round after leaving the area. This magical darkness foils darkvision, except for creatures that can see in magical darkness, such as devils. You can see within the area of the spell as if it were brightly lit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each creature you choose to be affected that ends its turn in the darkness takes 4d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. A successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the exhaustion.</p>

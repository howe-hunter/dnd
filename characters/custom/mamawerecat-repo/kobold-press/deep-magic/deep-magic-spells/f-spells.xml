<!-- FIENDISH BRAND  -->
	<element name="Fiendish Brand" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_FIENDISH_BRAND">
		<supports>Cleric,Warlock,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You infuse a branding iron (typically one bearing the mark of a demon lord or a lord of Hell) with the bone-chilling cold of the Lower Planes and a promise of damnation. To mark a creature with the brand, you make a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 cold damage to the target and cause it to become branded. The damage can be healed normally, but the brand remains until a remove curse spell is cast on the target, the duration expires, or you use an action to remove the brand. You can remove the brand from any distance, as long as the branded creature is on the same plane of existence as you.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the creature wears the brand, it has disadvantage on any saving throws it makes against spells you cast on it. If you try to locate the creature with a scrying spell, it takes the –10 penalty to its saving throw as if you possessed a lock of its hair or other body part.</p>

			<p>You take on some of the physical characteristics and abilities of the fire dragon, growing protective scales, wings, and claws. Until the spell ends, your AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing. You can take two actions on your turn to attack with your claws, dealing 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You are resistant to fire. Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of flames, dealing 6d8 fire damage to all creatures in the cone. A creature that succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon. Finally, the wings grant you a flying speed of 40 feet.</p>

			<p>You or a creature that you touch can see a few seconds into the future. When the spell is cast, each other creature within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail must declare, in initiative order, what their next action will be. The target of the spell declares his or her action last, after hearing what all other creatures will do. Each creature that declared an action must follow its declaration as closely as possible when its turn comes. For the duration of the spell, the target has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and creatures that declared their actions have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.</p>

			<p>You channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind. A target that gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw must roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to find its new alignment, and it must roll again after every minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends.

		<description>
			<p>Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn’t count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you’re not hidden.</p>

			<p>You blast a creature within range with a beam of pure, entropic energy that ages it rapidly.

While its Strength and Dexterity are reduced in this way, the creature can’t hold weapons weighing more than 3 pounds, its speed is halved, and it can’t take reactions.

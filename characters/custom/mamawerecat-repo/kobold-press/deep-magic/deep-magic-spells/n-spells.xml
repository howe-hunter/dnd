			<p>You create a shadow-tunnel between your location and one other creature you can see within range. You and that creature instantly swap positions. If the target creature is unwilling to exchange places with you, it can resist the effect by making a Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.</p>

			<p>	You summon evil spirits that take the form of a swarm of poisonous snakes and appear in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The swarm of snakes is considered a fiend as well as a beast. It has resistance to fire damage, and lasts until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the swarm, which takes its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the swarm, it moves to attack the nearest creature that is not your ally.</p>
			<p class="indent">The GM has the creature’s statistics.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you can summon additional swarms. You summon two swarms with a 5th-level spell slot, three swarms with a 7th-level spell slot, or four swarms with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>

			<p>You whisper in Void Speech and touch a weapon. Until the spell ends, the weapon turns black, becomes magical if it wasn’t before, and deals 2d6 necrotic damage (in addition to its normal damage) on a successful hit. A creature that takes necrotic damage from the enchanted weapon can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

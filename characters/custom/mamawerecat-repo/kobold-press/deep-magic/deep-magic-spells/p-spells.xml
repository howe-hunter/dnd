You must choose the target before rolling percentile dice to determine the nature of the surge. The DC of any required saving throw is calculated as if you were the caster.</p>

			<p>The creature you touch when casting this spell becomes immune to disease for the duration. The creature can still contract and carry diseases; it simply does not suffer any effects of a disease. When exposed to a disease, the creature must make the saving throw required. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes a carrier of the disease, and might expose others to it per the rules for the particular affliction. The creature under the effect of the spell is aware when it becomes infected. If the creature recovers from or is cured of all diseases it suffers while this spell is in effect, it continues to benefit from the spell until the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the duration expires, the target becomes susceptible to the effect of any disease it is still carrying, as if it had just now contracted it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 24 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

		<supports>Cleric</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast protective ice, you encase a willing target in icy, medium armor equivalent to a breastplate (AC 14). A creature without the appropriate armor proficiency has the usual penalties. If the target is already wearing armor, it only uses the better of the two armor classes.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature striking a target encased in protective ice with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d6 cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the armor’s wearer takes fire damage, an equal amount of damage is done to the armor, which has 30 hit points and is damaged only when its wearer takes fire damage. Damaged ice can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis, but the armor can’t have more than 30 points repaired.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot, it creates splint armor (AC 17, 40 hit points). If you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot, it creates plate armor (AC 18, 50 hit points). The armor’s hit points increase by 10 for each spell slot above 5th, but the AC remains 18. Additionally, if you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the armor deals an extra +2 cold damage for each spell slot above 3rd.</p>

			<p>Vampire slayers wander remote forests, haunted hills, and fog-bound moors, protecting the common folk of farming villages and cabins at the edge of civilized lands from the creatures of the night. Moving unseen through woodlands, your specialized training allows you to hunt vampires, ghouls, werewolves, and other monsters that prey on the innocent. Although you are most at home in the wilderness, as your skills improve, your attention might turn to older vampires that rule entire baronies, or that command dark keeps and sprawling manors closer to civilization.</p>

			<description>
				<p>Hags were horrible witches of wicked intent and ancient origin, dark fey tied to primal forces whose foul magic and mysterious malevolence haunted fairy tales and nightmares. Equal parts hideous and heinous, hags embodied what it meant to be ugly inside and out, taking on the forms of unsightly old women.</p>

			<requirements>[level:ranger:6]</requirements>
			<description>
				<p>One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p>

If you are wielding a magic weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage from one of your successful attacks on each of your turns.</p>

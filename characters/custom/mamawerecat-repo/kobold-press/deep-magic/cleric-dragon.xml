			<p>Dragons are known for many marvelous qualities: mastery of the most unforgiving environments, sagacity, long life, and an eternal hunger for ever more wealth and power. Those who worship dragons or the gods of dragons might strive to emulate several, or perhaps all, of these qualities themselves.</p>

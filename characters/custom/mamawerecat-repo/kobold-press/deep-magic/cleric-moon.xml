		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness moonlight, which banishes magical light and deals cold damage to your foes. When you present your holy symbol as an action and use your Channel Divinity, any magical light within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes cold damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can emit a nimbus of light in a 30-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. This effect acts as a light spell but provides only dim light. All weapons and ammunition are treated as silvered while they’re in the aura and for 1 round after leaving it. Opponents that end their turn in the aura must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be limned in silver light, identical in effect to a faerie fire spell, until the end of their next turn. You can use this feature three times, and you regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 17th level, whenever the moon is visible in the sky, you can use an action to detect magical pathways, portals, and gate effects.

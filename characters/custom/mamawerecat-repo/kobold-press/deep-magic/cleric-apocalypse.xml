			<p>Gods with the Apocalypse domain in their portfolios promote fear, judgment, punishment, and the end of all things. Priesthoods of such gods consider themselves the messengers of that doom, and they work to spread word of the coming end. Their gloomy, often frightening message makes them unwelcome in many, but not all, civilized places.</p>

A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to manipulate a creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature’s mind as an advantage when interrogating it.

On a failed save, you automatically know for the next 10 minutes whether anything the target says is true, a lie, or in between. On a successful save, the target cannot be affected by this spell until you finish a long rest.</p>

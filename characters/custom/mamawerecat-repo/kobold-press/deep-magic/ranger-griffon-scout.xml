		<description>
			<p>Elves of the forested woodlands and mountain foothills often uphold the tradition of taming and riding griffons, living on the same windswept crags where griffons nest, thus giving themselves the ability to command vast tracts of woodland territory. Trained by elf veterans and beast tamers, rangers of the Griffon Scout archetype learn to move swiftly and stealthily both on foot and while mounted, gathering information on their enemies and mounting devastating hit-and-run raids with precision and coordination.</p>

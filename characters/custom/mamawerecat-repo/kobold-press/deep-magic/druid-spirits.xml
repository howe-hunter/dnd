			<p>Some druids tend to more than the land. They also show concern for the health of the spirits of the land. Druids of the Circle of the Spirits build shrines in the wilderness where they commune with both these spirits and the souls of the departed.</p>

			<p><em>2nd-level Circle of Spirits feature</em></p>
			<p>Your bond with the spirits of nature grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of Spirits Spells table. </p>
			<p class="indent">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the service of a minor spirit guide. You can cast find familiar as a ritual.</p>
			<p class="indent">As long as you and your spirit guide (familiar) are within 100 feet of each other, the spirit guide can maintain concentration on a druid spell you cast. You must choose whether to do so yourself or make your spirit guide responsible for maintaining concentration at the moment the spell is cast, and that decision can’t be changed on a later turn. You can still have only one concentration spell in effect at a time; if you concentrate on a different spell or effect, the spirit guide’s concentration ends. You can still share your spirit guide’s senses and cast touch spells through the spirit guide normally while it’s maintaining concentration. The spirit guide makes Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration when it takes damage, not when you take damage.</p>

			<p>At 17th level, you can sacrifice the vitality of those around you and inspire an insatiable and horrifying hunger in them. Each living creature within 60 feet of you that fails a Charisma saving throw takes 10d8 necrotic damage and then succumbs to a ravening hunger, dropping whatever it holds and attacking unaffected creatures with their hands and teeth, or with whatever natural weapons they possess, in an attempt to devour them. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can exclude up to ten creatures from the effect, but this doesn’t shield them against being attacked by those who do succumb. This ability doesn’t affect constructs or the undead.</p>

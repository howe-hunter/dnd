			<p>All seek some form of justice when they have been wronged, and many live under the promise of its protection—whether or not the promise is ultimately kept—but few take on the holy burden of delivering the justice of the gods. The mercy of the divine, when in evidence at all, is not the mercy of mortals, and meting out divine justice makes for a lonely life. Yet someone must make the sacrifice.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape as an action to create a floral perfume that manipulates the minds of those who breathe it. One creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On each of your turns while the perfume lasts, you can use an action to choose a different creature within 10 feet of you to affect with your perfume.</p>

If it ends its turn outside the area, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you or your allies attack or harm a charmed creature, it is no longer charmed.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the creature’s saving throw is successful or if the effect ends for it, it is immune to your perfume for the next 24 hours. A creature that doesn’t breathe or that is immune to poison is immune to your perfume.</p>

			<p>Few ever catch a glimpse of the cold immensity of the stars and the Void, and fewer still are aware of the unfathomable powers that call such places home. Those who see beyond the veil of the mundane often go mad as a result of the irreconcilable clash between their conception of the world and the reality of universal insignificance. To learn what the Void has to teach, one must embrace its utter indifference toward life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Clerics who direct their reverence toward the Void and what it represents, rather than toward a deity or some other entity of the typical sort, can commit wholeheartedly to this discipline by following the path laid out in the Void domain.</p>

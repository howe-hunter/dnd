		<description>
			<p>This exquisite brocade coat is cut in a long, highcollared style popular among nobles of the Clovis Concord—a nation on the west coast of Wildemount whose stylish fashion is often mimicked in Tal’Dorei. Its shimmering lining hints at its magical properties.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this coat, which can be worn over light armor.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, the coat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you are the target of an attack while wearing this coat, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from the triggering attack. This resistance is effective against the triggering attack and lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>

<!-- Echo Stone -->

		<description>
			<p>This dull-blue river stone is soft to the touch, and makes remarkably little sound if dropped.</p>
			<p class="indent">When an echo stone is squeezed as an action, it glows faintly for 1 minute. The stone records all sound made within 15 feet of it while glowing, then repeats that recorded sound at an equal volume once every 5 minutes. This cycle of repetition continues until the stone is squeezed again as an action, which silences it. Squeezing the stone twice in quick succession as an action causes it to play the sounds it has most recently recorded, rather than recording new sounds.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated as an action, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different planes. When a single mirror of infinite transpondence is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the connection between the two mirrors has been activated three times from either end, it can’t be activated again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This black crystal pendant is a magical gateway to a small pocket dimension. You can use the pendant as an improvised weapon to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped within the crystal. A creature that wants to be trapped can intentionally fail this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only one creature at a time can be held in a raven’s slumber. That creature is aware of the passage of time and can see the world outside of this talisman as if through a window. You can release a held creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a companion creature granted to you by a class feature, or a beast that you’ve tamed as a companion, is reduced to 0 hit points while within 100 feet of you, it is immediately drawn into the pendant and stabilized. If the pendant already holds a creature, this effect fails.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This humble steel rod is engraved with tiny symbols representing different weapons, as well as the monogram “T.D.”</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature holding this rod can speak the name of any simple or martial weapon aloud as a bonus action, causing the rod to transform into an ordinary weapon of that type. When in the form of a ranged weapon, this rod magically creates its own ammunition, which disappears after a ranged attack hits or misses.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These dark leather boots look to be of common make, but a subtle pattern of swirling storm clouds upon their soles suggests the potency of their enchantment. You can activate these boots as part of your movement, gaining the following benefits until the end of your turn:</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a flying speed of 90 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you move within 5 feet of a hostile creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 lightning damage. A creature can’t be damaged in this way more than once per turn.</p>

<!-- Earthboard -->

		<description>
			<p>An earthboard is a slab of granite about three inches thick, nine feet long, and two feet wide, with smooth, tapered ends. However, its mundane appearance belies its unique elemental power, which reduces its weight to 40 pounds while a creature is attuned to it. The Earth Ashari of Terrah can often be seen with these stone boards upon their backs as they trek into the crags of the Cliffkeep Mountains.</p>
			<p class="indent">While standing on an earthboard, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent">Your speed increases to 60 feet as the board skims across solid ground (but not liquid surfaces).</p>
			<p class="indent">If you ramp off a surface of solid earth, you can long jump up to 60 feet. When you end this jump, you can choose to slam into the ground, creating a shockwave. Each creature standing on the ground within 20 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a burrowing speed of 20 feet that allows you to tunnel through earth or solid rock, leaving a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in your wake. As an action, you can increase this burrowing speed to 60 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The earthboard always moves with you until you decide to dismount it (no action required).</p>
			<p>These benefits last until you end your turn not standing on the earthboard.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This wrought-iron lantern holds a small fire elemental spirit. To attune to this item, you must also succeed on a DC 10 Charisma check to bond with the spirit inside the lantern.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Light and Flame.</b></i> While attuned to the lantern, you can verbally ask the elemental to glow (no action required), causing the lantern to cast bright light in a radius of your choice up to 60 feet and dim light for the same distance beyond that. You can also cast the produce flame cantrip from the lantern at will. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Elemental Essence.</b></i> The fire elemental spirit in the lantern can grant you a small fragment of its power.  Once the elemental has shared its power with you in this way, it can’t do so again until the next dawn. As an action, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 hour:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li>
				<li>Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, that creature takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
				<li>You can cast the burning hands spell (spell save DC 15) from the lantern at 3rd level. Once you cast the spell, you can’t do so again until the next time you use this property of the lantern.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Willful Attunement.</b></i> Your attunement to the lantern lasts until you choose to end it, or until you anger the elemental (by dousing the lantern in water, attacking another nonhostile elemental being, and so forth). You can attempt to attune to the lantern again and repeat the check to bond with the elemental during a short or long rest, but you make this check with disadvantage until you have made amends to the spirit, as the GM determines.</p>

			<p>These bat-like wings were first used by the Air Ashari to soar through the sky. They are constructed of either leather and bone, or cloth and wood, and are set onto a sturdy wooden pole that helps their user remain stable during flight.</p>
			<p class="indent">While these wings are open and you are riding the skysail, you can glide through the air. You have a flying speed of 60 feet, but you must descend at least 10 feet by the end of each of your turns and you can’t gain altitude.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, while in contact with the skysail, you can use an action to cast the fly spell on yourself, with a duration of 1 minute and requiring no concentration. The spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn, or unless the skysail is immersed in powerful magic of elemental air. (This includes magic such as that found at the top of the Summit Peaks near the rift of air in Zephrah, or on the Elemental Plane of Air).</p>
			<p class="indent">When the skysail is not in use, its wings can be retracted, and its pole can be used as a quarterstaff.</p>

When you hit with an attack, you can expend any number of charges from the cloak, with the attack dealing an extra 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended. If your attack strikes multiple targets, you choose one target that takes this extra damage.</p>

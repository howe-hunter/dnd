		<description>
			<p>You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You learn the invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the illusion or necromancy school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</li>

		<description>
			<p>While wearing this circlet, the wearer's Charisma score decreases by 2. They also have advantage on initiative rolls. When making an attack roll, the wearer can use their reaction to gain a +5 bonus to the roll. They make this choice after they see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses. The wearer cannot use this ability again until they finish a short or long rest.</p>

  <element name="Jim's Missile Defense System" type="Magic Item" source="hunters-edits" id="ID_HUNTER_HH_HE_MAGIC_ITEM_JIMS_MISSILE_DEFENSE">
		<description>
			<p>As a bonus action, three (or however many are remaining for the day) twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force appear in a triangle floating behind your head. When an enemy gets within ten feet of you, you may target them with 1-3 missiles. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, the missile does 2d4 force damage. If the attack roll scores a critical, the missile does 5d4 force damage instead of the 4d4 force that you would normally get on a critical. If any of the attack roll is a natural one, all missiles turn around and hit the caster for 3 force damage per missile. Regains all missiles at dawn. Missiles can not trigger on your turn. Missiles only trigger when someone enters the radius, starting within the zone or teleporting in do not activate missiles.</p>
